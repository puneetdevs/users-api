# Files

Provided is a clean install of Laravel.  You are given 24 hours to finish the assignment.  You are allowed to install and utilize any package you feel will help you get the job done.

# Problem to Solve

The purpose of this test is to gauge your skills in the day-to-day problems.  For example, we deal with a fair amount of ETL (extract, transform, load) processes so it's only natural for us to give you a basic ETL task.  To start, we will need to get the results from an API every 24 hours.  We will then need to save that data to a file and process it into our database.  Once that's complete, we will also need the ability retrieve those results using an API endpoint.  Also include tests for the code.
